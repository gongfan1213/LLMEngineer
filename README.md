If you are coming from the first edition, you will find that the code has been updated to use a more recent OpenAI Python library version. You will also find additional code examples that are not in this book's first edition. To switch back to the original code, go to <a href="https://github.com/malywut/gpt_examples/releases/tag/0.27">this tag</a>. The chapters and numbering of the examples are identical across book editions.
