#### 3.4.1 项目1：构建新闻稿生成器
GPT - 4和ChatGPT等LLM专用于生成文本。我们可以使用GPT - 4和ChatGPT在各种场景中生成文本，举例如下：
- 电子邮件
- 合同或正式文档
- 创意写作
- 逐步行动计划
- 头脑风暴
- 广告
- 职位描述


可能性是无限的。对于本项目，我们将创建一个工具，它可以根据一系列事实生成新闻稿。我们可以根据目标媒体和受众选择新闻稿的篇幅、语调和风格。

让我们从导入openai库和一个包装函数开始，用于调用ChatGPT模型：

```python
import openai
def ask_chatgpt(messages):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=messages
    )
    return response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
```

接着构建提示词。我们使用第4章将详细介绍的一种技术，以获得更好的结果：给AI模型分配一个角色，并尽可能精确地描述任务。在本例中，我们给AI模型分配的角色是记者助手：

```python
prompt_role = "You are an assistant for journalists. \
Your task is to write articles, based on the FACTS that are \
given to you. \
You should respect the instructions: the TONE, the LENGTH, \
and the STYLE"
```

下面定义主函数：

```python
from typing import List
def assist_journalist(
    facts: List[str], tone: str, length_words: int, style: str
):
    facts = ", ".join(facts)
    prompt = f"{prompt_role} \
FACTS: {facts} \
TONE: {tone} \
LENGTH: {length_words} words \
STYLE: {style}"
    return ask_chatgpt([{"role": "user", "content": prompt}])
```

现在用一个简单的测试来看看效果：

```python
print(
    assist_journalist(
        ["The sky is blue", "The grass is green"], "informal", 100, "blogpost"
    )
)
```

我们获得以下文本：

```
Hey, everyone! Did you know that the sky is blue and the grass is green? I mean, it's something we see every day and probably take for granted, but it's still pretty amazing if you think about it! The sky appears blue to us because of something called Rayleigh scattering – basically, the molecules in the Earth's atmosphere scatter sunlight in all different directions. Blue light has a shorter wavelength, so it gets scattered more than the other colors in the spectrum. That's why the sky looks blue most of the time! As for the grass being green... that's due to chlorophyll, the pigment that helps plants capture sunlight to make their food. Chlorophyll absorbs red and blue light, but reflects green light, which is why we see plants as green.
It's pretty cool how science explains these things we take for granted, don't you think? Next time you're outside, take a moment to appreciate the color palette around you!
```

再进行不同的尝试：

```python
print(
    assist_journalist(
        [
            "A book on ChatGPT has been published last week",
            "The title is Developing Apps with GPT-4 and ChatGPT",
            "The publisher is O'Reilly.",
        ],
        "excited",
        50,
        "news flash",
    )
)
```

结果如下：

```
Exciting news for tech enthusiasts! O'Reilly has just published a new book on ChatGPT called "Developing Apps with GPT-4 and ChatGPT". Get ready to delve into the world of artificial intelligence and learn how to develop apps using the latest technology. Don't miss out on this opportunity to sharpen your skills!
```

该项目展示了LLM在文本生成方面的能力。正如你所见，只需几行代码，就可以构建一个简单但非常有效的工具。
请使用我们在随书文件包中提供的代码自行尝试，并根据具体的需求调整提示词。
